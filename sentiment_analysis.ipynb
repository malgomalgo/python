    "   It is believed that the process of classification constitutes the core of human and artificial intelligence and is considered essential when it comes to tasks that concern processing linguistic data. With such an expansion of social media and users’ input into the Web, it is possible to make use of a massive amount of unstructured data. Thanks to the constantly developing technology, we can extract the most significant information contained in the text. The phenomena of computational study of people’s opinions towards products or services is known under the name of sentiment analysis or opinion mining. \n",
    "\n",
    "The positive and useful results of this operation are indubitable. With such information, companies are able to better understand a client’s attitude and, as a result, to plan upgraded strategies in order to meet the expectations. Not only can the businesses monitor the opinion, but also they might control what kind of information a potential client will acknowledge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the task of sentiment analysis is fairly challenging as there are various issues concerning both technical and semantic aspects. The simplest method of analysing the sentiment is a binary classification task in which classes are positive and negative, however we must realise that human thoughts are structured and more complex, thus while classifying <extended> utterances, this method will hardly reflect a full image of an actual sentiment. Moreover, it is possible that the classifiers’ actions might result in representational harms caused by replicated biases in training data, prejudicially applied labels, partial data resources or by the algorithm itself. <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/old_oct19/4.pdf\">(Jurafsky, D., Martin, J. H.)</a> As for technicalities of automated opinion mining, irony, sarcasm and the context are very difficult to be taken under consideration. What’s more, dealing with negation while analysing sentiments can cause various difficulties as we often need context to determine whether a phrase is negative or positive. "

      "      the hostess to retire into another room which was provided with shutters\n",

      "      comes to him, and must count fast; whoever stops or mistakes is to have a\n",
      "      box on the ear, and so on, till we have counted a thousand.\" It was\n",
      "      delightful to see the fun. She went round the circle with upraised arm.\n",
      "      \"One,\" said the first; \"two,\" the second; \"three,\" the third; and so on,\n",

      "      on the ear; and, amid the laughter that ensued, came another box; and so\n",
      "      on, faster and faster. I myself came in for two. I fancied they were\n",
      "      harder than the rest, and felt quite delighted. A general laughter and\n",
      "      confusion put an end to the game long before we had counted as far as a\n",
      "      thousand. The party broke up into little separate knots: the storm had\n",
      "      ceased, and I followed Charlotte into the ballroom. On the way she said,\n",
      "      \"The game banished their fears of the storm.\" I could make no reply. \"I\n",

      "      air around us with delicious odours. Charlotte leaned forward on her arm;\n",
      "      her eyes wandered over the scene; she raised them to the sky, and then\n",
      "      turned them upon me; they were moistened with tears; she placed her hand\n",
      "      on mine and said, \"Klopstock!\" at once I remembered the magnificent ode\n",
      "      which was in her thoughts: I felt oppressed with the weight of my\n",
      "      sensations, and sank under them. It was more than I could bear. I bent\n",
      "      over her hand, kissed it in a stream of delicious tears, and again looked\n",
      "      up to her eyes. Divine Klopstock! why didst thou not see thy apotheosis in\n",

      "      he, \"we do not know who planted it,&mdash;some say one clergyman, and some\n",
      "      another: but the younger one, there behind us, is exactly the age of my\n",
      "      wife, fifty years old next October; her father planted it in the morning,\n",

      "      inquired for his daughter. He said she was gone with Herr Schmidt to the\n",

      "      Herr Schmidt. She welcomed Charlotte affectionately, and I confess I was\n",
      "      much taken with her appearance. She was a lively-looking, good-humoured\n",
      "      brunette, quite competent to amuse one for a short time in the country.\n",
      "      Her lover (for such Herr Schmidt evidently appeared to be) was a polite,\n",
      "      reserved personage, and would not join our conversation, notwithstanding\n",
      "      all Charlotte's endeavours to draw him out. I was much annoyed at\n",
      "      observing, by his countenance, that his silence did not arise from want of\n",
      "      talent, but from caprice and ill-humour. This subsequently became very\n",
      "      evident, when we set out to take a walk, and Frederica joining Charlotte,\n",
      "      with whom I was talking, the worthy gentleman's face, which was naturally\n",
      "      rather sombre, became so dark and angry that Charlotte was obliged to\n",
      "      touch my arm, and remind me that I was talking too much to Frederica.\n",
      "      Nothing distresses me more than to see men torment each other;\n",

      "      pleasure, they waste their few short days of sunshine in quarrels and\n",
      "      disputes, and only perceive their error when it is too late to repair it.\n",
      "      This thought dwelt upon my mind; and in the evening, when we returned to\n",

      "      conversation turned on the joys and sorrows of the world, I could not\n",
      "      resist the temptation to inveigh bitterly against ill-humour. \"We are\n",
      "      apt,\" said I, \"to complain, but&mdash;with very little cause, that our\n",
      "      happy days are few, and our evil days many. If our hearts were always\n",
      "      disposed to receive the benefits Heaven sends us, we should acquire\n",

      "      \"we cannot always command our tempers, so much depends upon the\n",
      "      constitution: when the body suffers, the mind is ill at ease.\" \"I\n",
      "      acknowledge that,\" I continued; \"but we must consider such a disposition\n",

      "    <p>\n",
      "      \"I should be glad to hear one,\" said Charlotte: \"at least, I think very\n",
      "      much depends upon ourselves; I know it is so with me. When anything annoys\n",
      "      me, and disturbs my temper, I hasten into the garden, hum a couple of\n",
      "      country dances, and it is all right with me directly.\" \"That is what I\n",
      "      meant,\" I replied; \"ill-humour resembles indolence: it is natural to us;\n",
      "      but if once we have courage to exert ourselves, we find our work run fresh\n",
      "      from our hands, and we experience in the activity from which we shrank a\n",
      "      real enjoyment.\" Frederica listened very attentively: and the young man\n",
      "      objected, that we were not masters of ourselves, and still less so of our\n",
      "      feelings. \"The question is about a disagreeable feeling,\" I added, \"from\n",
      "      which every one would willingly escape, but none know their own power\n",
      "      without trial. Invalids are glad to consult physicians, and submit to the\n",
      "      most scrupulous regimen, the most nauseous medicines, in order to recover\n",
      "      their health.\" I observed that the good old man inclined his head, and\n",
      "      exerted himself to hear our discourse; so I raised my voice, and addressed\n",
      "      myself directly to him. \"We preach against a great many crimes,\" I\n",
      "      observed, \"but I never remember a sermon delivered against ill-humour.\"\n",
      "      \"That may do very well for your town clergymen,\" said he: \"country people\n",

      "      to my wife for instance, and the judge.\" We all laughed, as did he\n",
      "      likewise very cordially, till he fell into a fit of coughing, which\n",
      "      interrupted our conversation for a time. Herr Schmidt resumed the subject.\n",
      "      \"You call ill humour a crime,\" he remarked, \"but I think you use too\n",
      "      strong a term.\" \"Not at all,\" I replied, \"if that deserves the name which\n",
      "      is so pernicious to ourselves and our neighbours. Is it not enough that we\n",
      "      want the power to make one another happy, must we deprive each other of\n",
      "      the pleasure which we can all make for ourselves? Show me the man who has\n",
      "      the courage to hide his ill-humour, who bears the whole burden himself,\n",
      "      without disturbing the peace of those around him. No: ill-humour arises\n",
      "      from an inward consciousness of our own want of merit, from a discontent\n",
      "      which ever accompanies that envy which foolish vanity engenders. We see\n",
      "      people happy, whom we have not made so, and cannot endure the sight.\"\n",
      "      Charlotte looked at me with a smile; she observed the emotion with which I\n",
      "      spoke: and a tear in the eyes of Frederica stimulated me to proceed. \"Woe\n",
      "      unto those,\" I said, \"who use their power over a human heart to destroy\n",
      "      the simple pleasures it would naturally enjoy! All the favours, all the\n",
      "      attentions, in the world cannot compensate for the loss of that happiness\n",
      "      which a cruel tyranny has destroyed.\" My heart was full as I spoke. A\n",
      "      recollection of many things which had happened pressed upon my mind, and\n",

      "      too general, or only half true, he never ceases to qualify, to modify, and\n",

      "      illness was but short, but she was calm and resigned; and it was only for\n",
      "      her children, especially the youngest, that she felt unhappy. When her end\n",

      "      hands to heaven, and prayed over them; then, kissing them in turn, she\n",
      "      dismissed them, and said to me, 'Be you a mother to them.' I gave her my\n",
      "      hand. 'You are promising much, my child,' she said: 'a mother's fondness\n",
      "      and a mother's care! I have often witnessed, by your tears of gratitude,\n",
      "      that you know what is a mother's tenderness: show it to your brothers and\n",

      "      satisfaction, expressive of her conviction that we should be happy,&mdash;happy\n",

      "      this more acutely than the children: they cried and lamented for a long\n",

      "      grows darker and darker as it winds its way among them, till it ends in a\n",

      "      conversed on many subjects, and, without perceiving it, approached the\n",

      "      beside her. I did the same, but my agitation did not suffer me to remain\n",
      "      long seated. I got up, and stood before her, then walked backward and\n",
      "      forward, and sat down again. I was restless and miserable. Charlotte drew\n",
      "      our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which threw a\n",

      "      I thought I should have fainted: never had I received praise so\n",

      "      illness was but short, but she was calm and resigned; and it was only for\n",
      "      her children, especially the youngest, that she felt unhappy. When her end\n",
      "      drew nigh, she bade me bring them to her. I obeyed. The younger ones knew\n",
      "      nothing of their approaching loss, while the elder ones were quite\n",
      "      overcome with grief. They stood around the bed; and she raised her feeble\n",

      "      dismissed them, and said to me, 'Be you a mother to them.' I gave her my\n",

      "      and a mother's care! I have often witnessed, by your tears of gratitude,\n",
      "      that you know what is a mother's tenderness: show it to your brothers and\n",

      "      is a worthy man, to whom I am engaged.\" Now, there was nothing new to me\n",
      "      in this (for the girls had told me of it on the way); but it was so far\n",
      "      new that I had not thought of it in connection with her whom, in so short\n",
      "      a time, I had learned to prize so highly. Enough, I became confused, got\n",
      "      out in the figure, and occasioned general confusion; so that it required\n",
      "      all Charlotte's presence of mind to set me right by pulling and pushing me\n",

      "      When any distress or terror surprises us in the midst of our amusements,\n",
      "      it naturally makes a deeper impression than at other times, either because\n",

      "      our senses are then more open to impressions, and the shock is\n",
      "      consequently stronger. To this cause I must ascribe the fright and shrieks\n",
      "      of the ladies. One sagaciously sat down in a corner with her back to the\n",
      "      window, and held her fingers to her ears; a second knelt down before her,\n",
      "      and hid her face in her lap; a third threw herself between them, and\n",
      "      embraced her sister with a thousand tears; some insisted on going home;\n",
      "      others, unconscious of their actions, wanted sufficient presence of mind\n",
      "      to repress the impertinence of their young partners, who sought to direct\n",
      "      to themselves those sighs which the lips of our agitated beauties intended\n",

      "      the hostess to retire into another room which was provided with shutters\n",
      "      and curtains. We had hardly got there, when Charlotte placed the chairs in\n",

      "      comes to him, and must count fast; whoever stops or mistakes is to have a\n",
      "      box on the ear, and so on, till we have counted a thousand.\" It was\n",
      "      delightful to see the fun. She went round the circle with upraised arm.\n",
      "      \"One,\" said the first; \"two,\" the second; \"three,\" the third; and so on,\n",

      "      on the ear; and, amid the laughter that ensued, came another box; and so\n",
      "      on, faster and faster. I myself came in for two. I fancied they were\n",
      "      harder than the rest, and felt quite delighted. A general laughter and\n",
      "      confusion put an end to the game long before we had counted as far as a\n",

      "      ceased, and I followed Charlotte into the ballroom. On the way she said,\n",
      "      \"The game banished their fears of the storm.\" I could make no reply. \"I\n",

      "      so, since that time, I have kept all my weapons unloaded. But, my dear\n",

      "      all men till they come to \"however;\"—for it is self-evident that\n",

      "      too general, or only half true, he never ceases to qualify, to modify, and\n",
      "      extenuate, till at last he appears to have said nothing at all. Upon this\n",
      "      occasion, Albert was deeply immersed in his subject: I ceased to listen to\n",
      "      him, and became lost in reverie. With a sudden motion, I pointed the mouth\n",
      "      of the pistol to my forehead, over the right eye. \"What do you mean?\"\n",

      "      illness was but short, but she was calm and resigned; and it was only for\n",
      "      her children, especially the youngest, that she felt unhappy. When her end\n",

      "      dismissed them, and said to me, 'Be you a mother to them.' I gave her my\n",

      "      no other than the servant, who had been formerly so attached to the widow,\n",
      "      and whom he had met prowling about, with that suppressed anger and\n",

      "     \n",
      " \n",
      "      Several hours passed in this manner, and Charlotte's feelings became more\n",

      "      her depression became every moment greater, in proportion as she\n",

      "      Charlotte like a thunderstroke: she rose from her seat half-fainting, and\n",

      "      impatient look. She then delivered the fatal weapons to the servant,\n",
      "      without being able to utter a word. As soon as he had departed, she folded\n",
      "      up her work, and retired at once to her room, her heart overcome with the\n",

    "Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary domain comprising linguistics and computer science. It seems impossible to excel the performance of artificial intelligence without translating human language into data comprehensible for machines. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A basic task of computational linguists is to determine whether the expressed opinion in a text is positive, negative or neutral. Despite persistently improved methods and algorithms, this task remains a significant challenge for researchers. Therefore, with mindfully cleaned data, the desired results can be obtained. \n"
